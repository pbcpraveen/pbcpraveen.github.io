I&apos;m Praveen. While I wondered about our flimsy odds of existence in\n        this expanding cosmos, somewhere I learnt to live in it. When I&apos;m not lost in such\n        existential thoughts, I try materialise them in my poems. Somehow, my maverick mind finds\n        peace in alluring alliterations. If you are interested in reading some of it, navigate to\n        the poem section of this site &#128578;.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        For a more formal introduction, I finished my undergraduate in engineering at Anna\n        University in 2021, majoring in Computer Science. I have interned at Goldman Sachs for\n        nearly 8 months, where I have also worked as an Analyst for a year. I&apos;m an aspiring\n        researcher in the field of AI and Theoretical Computer Science. I&apos;m particularly\n        interested in Complexity Theory, Approximation and Algorithm Robustness. Now, I&apos;m a\n        first year master student at University of California, San Diego, specialising in\n        Theoretical Computer Science.
