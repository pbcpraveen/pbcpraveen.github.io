I have attempted to derive the gradients to implement gradient descent for\n          these two algorithms.

I have attempted to break down the math\n          with detailed explanation to every steps. The vanilla back propagation algorithm, a\n          variation of which is currently used for many state of art models, is also explained with\n          a simple example.
